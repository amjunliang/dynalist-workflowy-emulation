# How to emulate Workflowy in Dynalist

**Step 1 - Go Pro**

Only Dynalist Pro allows you to use custom CSS or change keyboard shortcuts. But you can test this in the free trial.

**Step 2 - Copy CSS from here**

Copy / paste the CSS in custom.css in this repo into Dynalist (Dynalist Pro settings)

**Step 3 - Change view preferences**

Change view preferences in Dynalist settings:
 - theme = Default
 - density = Cozy
 - font size = small
 - font = system
 - narrow document layout = tick (this emulates Workflowy Classic)
 - document border = tick (this emulates Workflowy Classic)

**Step 4 - Keyboard Shortcuts**

Edit keyboard shortcuts:
 - Expand/Collapse = Ctrl+Space
 - Zoom in = Alt+Right
 - Zoom out = Alt+Left
 - Swap with previous = Ctrl-Shift-Up, Ctrl-Up, Alt-Shift-Up (I threw the kitchen sink at this. Sometimes I forget which.)
 - Swap with next = similar to above
 - Delete item = Ctrl-Alt-Shift-Backspace (not workflowy. Adobe Lightroom, but I like it)
 - Duplicate = Ctrl-Shift-D (not workflowy. Sublime text editor and others)

The keyboard shortcuts in Dynalist are killer, I especially like ones like "Delete from above" and "Select this and previous item".
